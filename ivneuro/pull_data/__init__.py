ivneuro.pull_data
=================
A subpackage for extracting data from nex5 files.
It can also extract centroids and local field potentials, which do not have their own types in
NeuroExplorer, as a different type from continuous.
The NexData class puts together all the functions of this subpackage and creates a NexData object,
wich contains the extrated variables as attributes.
